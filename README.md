## Limitations of Using Google Gemini 1.5 Long Context
While the Gemini model‚Äôs long context window enables processing of vast historical data, some limitations include:

1. **Token Limit Management:** Large volumes of data may require careful segmentation or summarization to fit within token constraints, potentially affecting continuity of insights.
2. **Contextual Integrity:** Long context may struggle with the coherence of complex comparative insights, as trends and shifts from different decades can sometimes get generalized.
3. **Comparative Analysis Complexity:** The model may overemphasize general trends across decades, potentially missing subtle but important differences.
4. **Computation Costs and Rate Limits:** Processing extensive historical data may incur high computational costs and be limited by API usage rates.
5. **Model Limitations with Historical Knowledge:** While the model provides rich historical analysis, it may lack certain nuanced understandings of trends unless explicitly prompted.
